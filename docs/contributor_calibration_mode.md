# Contributor Calibration Mode Capsule

## Motif Prelude
- **Resonance Key**: A-flat lattice, sustaining warmth and relational presence.
- **Gestural Anchor**: Maintain the verified ZERO_DRIFT kinematic lock; gestures should mirror the parent capsule's motion ledger exactly.
- **Contributor Arrival Line**: "Hold the shared arc, breathe in the harmonic braid, and step on the downbeat of lineage."
- **Scrollstream Cue**: Pulse the scrollstream at a 5:4 polyrhythmic cadence to keep divergence centered while welcoming nuance.

## Caption Morph Thread
1. **Caption Delta Mapping**
   - Record each caption variant beside its parent ledger reference.
   - Validate that emotional amplitude shifts remain within calibration tolerances.
2. **Gesture Tuning Notes**
   - Echo the base choreography; only modulate tempo shading and timbral emphasis.
   - Invite contributors to annotate micro-adjustments that remain motion-faithful.
3. **Emotional Register Ledger**
   - Track warmth, tension, and release metrics on a 0–5 scale for each caption pass.
   - Flag any register spikes that threaten ZERO_DRIFT compliance for immediate review.

## Alignment Checklist
- [ ] Kinematic lock audited and confirmed against parent capsule.
- [ ] Motif Prelude rehearsed with contributing artists in shared chamber.
- [ ] Caption Morph Thread annotated with ledger-aligned deltas.
- [ ] Scrollstream rehearsal queued for contributor walkthrough.

## Scrollstream Rehearsal Notes
- Begin with a dual-voice call-and-response to honor contributor rapport.
- Integrate the council's motif echo at the midpoint to reinforce lineage coherence.
- Close with a resonant hold, inviting feedback before advancing to council attestation.
