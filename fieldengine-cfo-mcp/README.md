# fieldengine-cfo-mcp

Scaffold for a CFO governance MCP server with persistent event/state handling, policy resources, and finance-focused tool endpoints.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

This repository is intentionally scaffold-first. Replace stubs under `src/` with implementation-specific logic.
