# CIE-V1 Neutrality Scorecard (Stub)

This placeholder documents the evidence required to prove the ZERO-DRIFT
neutrality of the Content Integrity Evaluation Service modules. Populate this
scorecard with quantitative checks before promoting the sandbox beyond pilot
runs.

## Required Artifacts

- Latest DK-1.0 persona isolation report covering SNI and SCS modules.
- MIAP telemetry sampling summary demonstrating aggregate-only outputs.
- ZERO-DRIFT neutrality suite execution logs with pass/fail counts.
- Hash-linked references to ingress templates validated by the council.

## Open Actions

- Automate extraction of neutrality metrics from sandbox executions.
- Define attestation signers and quorum workflow for scorecard approval.
