  "Grid-scale batteries respond to frequency deviations within seconds to stabilize voltage, provided current capacity exceeds safety margins.",
  "Regulation capacity is reserved exclusively for frequency services unless a safety-margin breach is detected.",
  "Dispatch logic automatically throttles frequency services to preserve the safety margins defined in ssot://registry/trusted_uris/grid/safety_margins."
