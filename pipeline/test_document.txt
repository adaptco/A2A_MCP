This is a test document for the Docling Pipeline replay test.

The purpose of this document is to verify that the pipeline produces
deterministic results when processing the same input multiple times.

Key Features to Test:
1. Text normalization (NFKC, whitespace handling)
2. Chunking consistency
3. Embedding generation reproducibility
4. Hash chain integrity

This document contains multiple paragraphs to ensure proper chunking.
Each paragraph should be processed consistently across multiple runs.

The pipeline should produce identical hashes for:
- Document normalization
- Text chunks
- Embeddings
- Ledger entries

If all hashes match across runs, the pipeline is deterministic.
