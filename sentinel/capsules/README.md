# Sentinel capsules

Capsules encapsulate protocol events, their governance bindings, and the cockpit assets that render them.

## Catalog
- `capsules/doctrine/capsule.attestation.scroll.v1.json` – describes the Stack Freeze attestation capsule, including the ledger
  event it anchors, the HUD asset path, and the Merkle hash of the viewer bundle.

Add future capsule manifests under `capsules/` and reference them here so the Sentinel catalog stays up to date.
